How to Reserve CPU & Memory Resources in Kubernetes
Why we reserve this CPU or memory ? because in K8 Yaml to avoid lot of memory is being used by only those pods into the cluster. Pods can only use a limited cpu and memory.
 -In the yaml in Container specification we can restrict the memory and cpu in Resources section in yaml.
  requests - minimum value which is reserved 
  limits - max value can a pod use 
- kubectl -n default top pods <pod-name>
- kubectl describe node <node-name> -> This will show the memory and cpu reserved for a namespace in K8 cluster.
  - Here we can CPU requests, CPU limits, memory requests and memory limits.
